# coworking_space-module

Creating a simple coworking space module in Odoo involves several steps. The module will include three views: List, Kanban, and Tree. Here's a rough implementation plan:

-->Implementation Plan

1.Module Structure Setup:
Create a new module named coworking_space.
Set up the necessary file structure: models, views, and security.

coworking_space/
├── __init__.py
├── __manifest__.py
├── models/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── coworking_space.py
├── views/
│   ├── coworking_space_views.xml
│   ├── coworking_space_menu.xml
└── security/
    ├── __init__.py  # Optional, but usually not needed
    └── ir.model.access.csv

2.Define Models:
Create a model for the coworking space (e.g., CoworkingSpace).
Define fields such as name, location, capacity, amenities, availability, and any other relevant details.

3.Views Creation:
List View: Show a tabular list of all coworking spaces with key details like name, location, and capacity.
Kanban View: Show coworking spaces in a card format, useful for a visual overview.
Tree View: Display a hierarchical view if needed, though typically List and Kanban views suffice.

4.Access Rights:
Set up basic access rights and security rules for different user roles (e.g., managers, staff, guests).

5.Menu and Action Configuration:
Create a menu item for the module.
Set up actions to open the List, Kanban, and Tree views.
